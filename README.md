## 🐚 Shell_SO

🔧 A work-in-progress shell developed for the Operating Systems course.  
This project includes basic job control features and aims to simulate the behavior of common Unix shells.

⚠️ It's not in its final version yet — the README is still being improved, and more features will be added soon.
