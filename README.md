## 🌌 Star Wars HTTPS API Test

🚀 A Java-based university project focused on making HTTPS requests to the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.py4e.com), parsing data (characters, starships, etc.), and running basic question-based tests.

🔗 You can download the ready-to-run version as a [📦 ZIP file](https://github.com/Soviji13/University-Projects/raw/main/httpTestStarWars/basics.zip).

💡 This includes a TLS agent (`extract-tls-secrets-4.0.0.jar`) for optional HTTPS traffic analysis via Wireshark.
